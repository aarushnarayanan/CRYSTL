# CRYSTL
This Repository has all of the code I made for an alcohol detection camera. Some parts of code are missing and there is also isn't commit history because all the code was on an older laptop, and certain files got lost/deleted while trying to transfer to the new github. The README explains how the project works as well as the files.
